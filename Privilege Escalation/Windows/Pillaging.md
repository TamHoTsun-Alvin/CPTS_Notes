Pillaging is the technique to enumerate for information about our target or information that is useful to us.

Below are some of the sources from which we can obtain information from compromised systems:

- Installed applications
- Installed services
    - Websites
    - File Shares
    - Databases
    - Directory Services (such as Active Directory, Azure AD, etc.)
    - Name Servers
    - Deployment Services
    - Certificate Authority
    - Source Code Management Server
    - Virtualization
    - Messaging
    - Monitoring and Logging Systems
    - Backups
- Sensitive Data
    - Keylogging
    - Screen Capture
    - Network Traffic Capture
    - Previous Audit reports
- User Information
    - History files, interesting documents (.doc/x,.xls/x,password._/pass._, etc)
    - Roles and Privileges
    - Web Browsers
    - IM Clients

We can find installed application in these following 2 ways:
```
dir "C:\Program Files"
```

```
PS C:\htb> $INSTALLED = Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\* |  Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion, InstallLocation
PS C:\htb> $INSTALLED += Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\* | Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion, InstallLocation
PS C:\htb> $INSTALLED | ?{ $_.DisplayName -ne $null } | sort-object -Property DisplayName -Unique | Format-Table -AutoSize
```
