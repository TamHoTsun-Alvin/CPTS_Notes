ColdFusion is a programming language and web app dev platform based on Java, below is a list of port it opens and how can we identify presence of ColdFusion:

|Port Number|Protocol|Description|
|---|---|---|
|80|HTTP|Used for non-secure HTTP communication between the web server and web browser.|
|443|HTTPS|Used for secure HTTP communication between the web server and web browser. Encrypts the communication between the web server and web browser.|
|1935|RPC|Used for client-server communication. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol allows a program to request information from another program on a different network device.|
|25|SMTP|Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used for sending email messages.|
|8500|SSL|Used for server communication via Secure Socket Layer (SSL).|
|5500|Server Monitor|Used for remote administration of the ColdFusion server.|

|**Method**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Port Scanning`|ColdFusion typically uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS by default. So, scanning for these ports may indicate the presence of a ColdFusion server. Nmap might be able to identify ColdFusion during a services scan specifically.|
|`File Extensions`|ColdFusion pages typically use ".cfm" or ".cfc" file extensions. If you find pages with these file extensions, it could be an indicator that the application is using ColdFusion.|
|`HTTP Headers`|Check the HTTP response headers of the web application. ColdFusion typically sets specific headers, such as "Server: ColdFusion" or "X-Powered-By: ColdFusion", that can help identify the technology being used.|
|`Error Messages`|If the application uses ColdFusion and there are errors, the error messages may contain references to ColdFusion-specific tags or functions.|
|`Default Files`|ColdFusion creates several default files during installation, such as "admin.cfm" or "CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm". Finding these files on the web server may indicate that the web application runs on ColdFusion.|
Enumeration:

We can try to visit /CFIDE or /cfdocs to enumerate some information about the server, we can also visit the admin panel usually located at `/CFIDE/administrator`

Attacks:

All attacks introduced for ColdFusion are CVE based, 1 Unauthenticated RCE, Directory Traversal has been covered for ColdFusion 8, along with use of searchsploit, refer to https://academy.hackthebox.com/app/module/113/section/2135 for more detail
